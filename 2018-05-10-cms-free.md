## How We Build CMS-Free Websites

### Prose.io and Jekyll enable building simple, flexible, and reliable without the overhead of dynamic CMSs

It’s been almost two years since Development Seed deliberately stopped building websites with Drupal and moved away from CMS-driven applications altogether. Since then, our recent blog posts about investing in [Prose.io](http://prose.io), rebuilding [our own websites with Jekyll](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/09/09/jekyll-github-pages/), creating the [MapBox Map Site templates](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/), and launching new client-sponsored projects like [MIX Maps](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/26/mix-maps-portal/) indicate the new approach we’re taking. Informed by both the lessons learned by Development Seed over four years of leadership in the Drupal community and my own experience of going through two redesigns of WhiteHouse.gov and migrating it to a Drupal backend, what follows is my reflection on the evolution of our process and how it leads to simple, flexible, and reliable websites that allow for a renewed focus on design and strategy.
